# Sigmoid-Distortion
The distortion of analog circuits

# Sigmoids
* It's all the non-linear is
* S-curves
* Tanh
* ArcTan
* Alegbraic 1/(1+abs(x))

# Exponentials
* log(1+x)/log(2)

# Activation Functions
* all sigmoids 
* or hard clipping
* your brain is a distortion pedal

# You can waste alot of time modelling a circuit
* the same thing
* some kind of sigmoid
* same distortion in a neural network

# Different Flavors that's it
* symmetric
* assmetric
* polar
* quadratic

# You can generate endless varieties of it
* use gnuplot
* Plot your function
* Tweak it so it fits in [-1,1]
* Use it as distortion
